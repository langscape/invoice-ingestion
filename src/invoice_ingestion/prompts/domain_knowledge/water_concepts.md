# Water Domain Knowledge

## Water + Sewer Billing
Most water utility invoices include charges for both **water** supply and **sewer** (wastewater) service on the same bill. These are typically separate sections with separate charges but combined into a single total amount due. Some municipalities also include **stormwater/drainage** charges on the water bill, which are often flat fees unrelated to consumption.

## Tiered / Block Rates
Water utilities commonly use **tiered (inclining block) rates** to encourage conservation:
- **Tier 1 (Baseline)**: Lowest rate for essential usage (e.g., first 10 CCF).
- **Tier 2 (Moderate)**: Higher rate for usage above baseline (e.g., 10-20 CCF).
- **Tier 3 (Excessive)**: Highest rate for usage above moderate (e.g., above 20 CCF).
- Each tier has a different per-unit price, and the invoice shows consumption broken down by tier.
- Tier thresholds may vary by season (summer tiers may be more generous or less generous depending on the utility's conservation goals).
- Sewer charges may also be tiered, though less commonly.

## Base / Service Charge
A fixed **monthly service charge** (or base charge) covers meter maintenance, billing, and infrastructure costs. The service charge typically varies by **meter size** (5/8", 3/4", 1", 1.5", 2", 3", 4", 6", 8"). Larger meters have higher service charges because they require larger infrastructure. This is a fixed charge regardless of consumption.

## Stormwater / Drainage Fees
Many municipalities charge a **stormwater fee** based on impervious surface area (rooftops, parking lots) rather than water consumption. This appears as a flat monthly fee, often billed per ERU (Equivalent Residential Unit). Commercial properties may have higher stormwater charges based on assessed impervious area.

## Units of Measurement
- **CCF** (Centum Cubic Feet) = 100 cubic feet = 748 gallons. The most common metering unit in the US.
- **Gallons**: Some utilities bill directly in gallons or thousands of gallons (kgal).
- **m3** (cubic meters): Standard metric unit for water billing outside the US.
- **Liters**: Some invoices show liters, though billing is usually in m3.
- 1 m3 = 264.17 gallons. 1 CCF = 2.832 m3.

## Estimated vs Actual Reads
Water meters are sometimes read on alternate months, with estimated reads in between:
- **Actual read (A)**: Meter was physically read or remotely transmitted.
- **Estimated read (E)**: Based on historical usage patterns. Flagged with "E" or "EST".
- Estimated reads are trued up when the next actual read occurs, potentially causing a larger or smaller bill.

## Sewer Cap / Winter Average
Sewer charges are based on water consumption, since direct measurement of sewer flow is impractical for most customers. However, some utilities apply a **sewer cap** or **winter average** to avoid charging for water used for irrigation (which does not enter the sewer):
- **Winter average method**: Sewer volume is capped at the average winter consumption (e.g., December-March average), applied during summer months.
- **Sewer cap**: A hard cap on the number of units billed for sewer in any given month.
- Customers with separate irrigation meters are billed sewer only on the domestic meter.

## Fire Service / Fire Line Charges
Commercial and industrial customers with fire suppression connections (sprinkler systems) pay a **fire service charge** or **fire line charge** based on the size of the fire service connection. This is a fixed monthly charge.

## Backflow Prevention / Cross-Connection
Some utilities charge for **backflow prevention device testing** or **cross-connection control program** fees, typically annually.

## European Water Concepts

### Water + Wastewater + Stormwater (Assainissement)
European water invoices typically separate:
- **Eau potable / Trinkwasser / Acqua potabile**: Drinking water supply.
- **Assainissement / Abwasser / Fognatura**: Wastewater (sewer) service.
- **Eaux pluviales / Niederschlagswasser**: Stormwater management.
Each section may have its own fixed and variable charges.

### Metric Meter Sizes
European water meters are specified in metric sizes (DN15, DN20, DN25, DN32, DN40, DN50, etc.) corresponding to the nominal diameter in millimeters. The standing charge (abonnement) is based on meter size.

### Redevances and Taxes (France)
French water invoices include several regulated **redevances** (fees/levies):
- **Redevance de pollution**: Pollution levy, per m3, funds water treatment.
- **Redevance de preservation des ressources**: Resource preservation levy.
- **Redevance pour modernisation**: Modernization levy for collection networks.
These are set by the Agence de l'Eau (Water Agency) and appear as separate line items.

### VAT on Water
Water is typically subject to a **reduced VAT rate** in many European countries (e.g., 5.5% in France, 10% in Italy for domestic supply, 7% in Germany). Wastewater services may have a different VAT rate. The invoice must clearly separate the VAT treatment of each service.

### Cubic Meter Billing
All European water billing is in **m3** (cubic meters). Consumption is straightforward: current_read - previous_read = m3 consumed. No conversion factors are needed (unlike gas).
